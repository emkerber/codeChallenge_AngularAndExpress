This was an individual assignment at Prime Digital Academy. Below are the instructions provided.

Overview
For today's code challenge, you will be creating an Angular application that retrieves a list of students from your server and displays them on the page for the user to view.

Client
When the page first loads, the user should be presented with a display button that when clicked will call a function on your controller to fetch the list of students using the $http service and display it in a list on the page. It will look like this

Server
The server should serve the index page of your application at the root url. The server should also have a /students route that will respond to GET requests with a list of students in the class.
